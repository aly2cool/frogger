# Frogger Proposal

## What is Frogger?

Frogger was a 2D game that was created in 1981. It gained popularity throughout the 80s and 90s and became one of the top most played games
during its time. As i was growing up, Frogger was a game i frequented, and so i am attempting to replicate it, and see just how much went into this game.

## Initial thoughts on game structure

I expect the biggest challenge will be writing out the collision detection. I will attempt to implement an img as a moving frog, and another img as a vehicle driving back and fourth. As levels progress, i expect to add bigger vehicles, or maybe even faster.

## Phases of Completion

1. Creating game layout
1. Create objects (cars, frog).
1. Create functions for the objects (how to move frog; speed and direction of cars)
1. Create a function for keeping score and lives
1. Create a function to check for a win.

## Links and Resources

I will be referencing codepen to come up with a system for my collision detection.
